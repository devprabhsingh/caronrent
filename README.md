# CARonRENT

This project is a practice project build using React on frontend with PHP and MySQL on backend.

As gh-pages only allow static deployment so in order to deal with data just for demo, some temporary data is being used from frontend instead of making requests to backend.

### This is a fully desktop and mobile responsive website.
